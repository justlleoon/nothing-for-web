# Nothing for web
A stupid game ported to the internet!

> The hardest game you're ever going to play. Or is it?
> Just do Nothing as the timer goes up. If you do Something, you lose. 
> If you don't like doing Nothing, go play Something instead.

## Notes
There is a way you can cheat in this game, but do whatever you want.
I don't know when i will fix these bugs.
